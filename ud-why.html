        <h2>Why Universal Design Matters</h2>
        <p>Universal design is important for web design because if a website is accessible, usable, and convenient for everyone regardless of age or ability, it's inclusive for all. The need and desire for accessible and inclusive websites will only grow as our population continues to age. With older age comes mobility, vision, and hearing challenges, and many of us will need universally designed sites so that we can continue to be part of our communities and live our lives to their full potential.</p>

        <h2>Reasons You Should Implement Universal Design</h2>
        <h3> Reach More Customers </h3>
        <p>To put things in perspective, millions of people in the United States alone have a disability of some sort. If your site or product is accessible, more people will be willing to spend their money on it.</p>

        <h3> It is a Moral Responsibility </h3>
        <p>In today's world, life without the internet isn't an option for most people. The web has proven to be the hub for resources, information, and opportunities. As such, access to websites has become a basic necessity. By being compassionate enough to make your site accessible, you're making many people's lives a whole lot easier, and that's morally commendable.</p>

        <h3> Stay Out of Legal Trouble </h3>
        <p>There have been many <a href="https://www.essentialaccessibility.com/blog/web-accessibility-lawsuits"> federally filed cases</a> regarding accessibility in the US as more and more citizens with disabilities are beginning to recognize their rights. These cases are expected to rise because many sites aren't accessible. If you want to avoid the time, effort, and monetary expense of fending off a lawsuit, then making your website accessible should be a priority.</p>

        <h3> Improve Public Image </h3>
        <p>An accessible site is a competitive advantage. If people know that you care about universal design, you will have increased customer satisfaction and retention. Also, word spreads fast. If your site isn't accessible, people will recognize that you are depriving them of digital information and opportunities. This can ruin your reputation.</p>

        <h3> Better User Experience For Everyone </h3>
        <p>Making an accessible site goes beyond just helping people with disabilities. For example, making your site clean and simplified can certainly make it easier for those with cognitive disabilities to find information. It also makes it easier for everyone else to find information too. When everyone is happy with your site, it only benefits you.</p>
