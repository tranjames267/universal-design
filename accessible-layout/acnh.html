            <p>
                Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a 2020 social simulation game developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch; it is the fifth main entry in the Animal Crossing series. In New Horizons, the player controls a character who moves to a deserted island after purchasing a getaway package from Tom Nook, accomplishes assigned tasks, and develops the island as they choose. They can gather and craft items, customize the island, and develop it into a community of anthropomorphic animals.

            <h2> Gameplay </h2>
            <p>                
                As in previous Animal Crossing games, New Horizons is a life simulation game played in real time. Weather also adjusts to the seasons of the Northern or Southern Hemisphere, depending on the player's real-world location, a first for the Animal Crossing series. The game follows a villager customized by the player,[3] who, after purchasing a getaway package from Tom Nook, moves into a deserted island.[4] After Tom Nook gives the player essentials, such as a tent, the game proceeds in a non-linear fashion, allowing for the player to play the game as they choose.[5]

                The player is given open access to natural resources such as fruit and wood, which can be collected and crafted into a variety of items and furniture known as D.I.Y. crafting. Alongside this, they can catch bugs and fish, plant and grow trees and flowers,[9] extract natural resources such as rocks,[10] and swim in the ocean.[11] The island gives open space for placing items and decorating as the player chooses.[12] Certain content available, such as organisms, are season-dependant and only appear for a limited time of the year. Doing simple tasks rewards the player with "Nook Miles", which in return can purchase premium rewards in Resident Services. The other currency "Bells", a staple in the Animal Crossing franchise, can be used to purchase other goods and services.

            <h2> Game Concepts </h2>
            <p>
                The developers noticed that players would repeatedly restart games in the previous series over and over, in hopes to get an island shape that they want. Because of this, landscaping was implemented to allow for easy shaping of the island. Another issue they noticed was "time-traveling"; due to the game running in real-time, players would change the clock on the console to put themselves further into the future so they don't have to wait in real-time. To help avoid this, they made sure landscaping and crafting did not have any wait-time restrictions.[40] They also tied seasonal events to updates instead of implementing the content into the game from the beginning so players could not skip ahead and retrieve exclusive items. The interest rate in the game's bank system was also decreased to lower the incentive of time-traveling.

            <h2> Graphics and Art </h2>
            <p>
              The game's art director, Koji Takahashi, went under the philosophy of "trigger of play". The concept makes sure there is something within the player's field of vision or grasp that would want them to explore the concept. With this, the island was designed from a 45-degree angle similar to that of a cylinder, or a "curved" perspective, where the player could view other content occurring in the background that would "trigger" them to investigate further or interact. By making an everyday concept simple and easy to grasp, it would cause the player to explore it further and be able to easily pick up the new material. If the game's art was complicated and realistic, according to Takahashi, the player would possibly receive too much information and make progression difficult. The simple design allowed for a multiple of one object to be stacked close to each other, such as flowers, or allow for simplistic objects to compliment others.[52] By leaving empty space and with a simplistic design, with simple graphics and little nature complexity, Takahashi explains how it would have the player attempt to fill in that gap with their own perspectives and ideas, called the "imagination gap", and further motivation to create their own designs and space with the features available.

            The commercial success of Animal Crossing New Horizons has been attributed in part to its release amid global stay-at-home orders during the COVID-19 pandemic. The game has been used as a substitute for social interactions such as weddings and graduation ceremonies, as well as political campaigning and virtual protests.The game also inspired fan creations, such as a trading website, a talk show, and other comics and merchandise.

          <h2>Updates</h2>
          <p>
            Since the game depends on seasonal changes, New Horizons receives frequent updates, adding new seasonal items, events, and sometimes new gameplay features. Most updates are loosely based around national holidays, with the first update being themed around "Bunny Day" in April 2020 and based on Easter. Other seasonal updates followed, being "Nature Day" (Earth Day), May Day,[26] Halloween,[27] "Turkey Day" (Thanksgiving), and "Toy Day" (Christmas).[28] Other popular seasonal events, such as summer, also came with new items.[29][30]
          </p>
          <p>
            Each respective update also featured popular characters from past Animal Crossing games. With each update, the island changed in look, and the player's island is often decorated for the occasion. Alongside seasonal changes, Nintendo has also released themed items from other popular media, such as Mario outfits and decor in celebration of the franchise's 35th anniversary.[31]
