      <h2> What Universal Design Means </h2>
      <p>
        Universal design is the design of products or environments to make them accessible to people, regardless of age, disability or other factors. It addresses common barriers to participation by creating things that can be used by the maximum number of people possible. There are seven principles that further describe what universal design entails.

        In the context of webpages, universal design means that any user can find and access information that your website has to offer. Different users can have different disabilities, which includes visual, auditory, mobility, and cognitive impairments. A web designer's job is to essentially make meaningful user interactions for any website user. This takes a lot of design decisions that require a variety of perspectives. Luckily, Norman's design concepts are a great tool to start guiding these decisions.

        <h2>Norman's Design Concepts</h2>
        <p>Donald Norman, one of the most notable researchers in the field of human-computer interaction and user-centered design, provides six key design principles to keep in mind while designing any interface. Norman's idea is that devices, computers, and interfaces should function correctly and be intuitive and easy to use.</p>

      <details>
        <summary> Visibility </summary>
        <p> Users should know, just by looking at an interface, what their options are and how to access them. It is essential to include only the options that are needed. </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary> Feedback </summary>
        <p> The user must receive feedback after every action they perform to let them know whether or not their action was successful.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary> Affordance </summary>
        <p> Affordance is the link between how things look and how they are used.The design should be intuitive enough that the users know how to access their desired information just by looking at the interface. </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary> Mapping </summary>
        <p> Mapping is the idea that, in a good design, the controls for something will closely resemble their effect. </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary> Constraints </summary>
        <p> Constraints restrict a particular form of user interaction with an interface. This is essential because the user could become overwhelmed with the range of possibilities available through an interface. </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary> Consistency </summary>
        <p> People learn new things and manage better when they recognize patterns. Consistency is key for these patterns to be recognized and learned by users. If similar-looking things do not produce a similar output, the user is bound to become frustrated. </p>

    <h2> 7 Principles of Universal Design </h2>
  <ol>
    <li> Equitable Use
        <p>The design is useful and appealing for all people of all abilities</p>
    </li>
    <li> Flexibility in Use
        <p>The design accommodates a wide range of individual preferences and abilities</p>
    </li>
    <li> Simple and Intuitive Use
        <p>The design is easy to use and understand, regardless of the user's experience, knowledge, language skills, or current concentration level</p>
    </li>
    <li> Perceptible Information
        <p>The design communicates necessary information effectively to the user, regardless of the user's sensory abilities</p>
    </li>
    <li> Tolerance for Error
        <p>The design minimizes hazards and the adverse consequences of accidental or unintended actions</p>
    </li>
    <li> Low Physical Effort
        <p>The design can be used efficiently and comfortably with minimal effort</p>
    </li>
    <li> Size and Space for Approach and Use
        <p>The design has appropriate size and space for approach, reach and manipulation regardless of physical characteristics or conditions</p>
