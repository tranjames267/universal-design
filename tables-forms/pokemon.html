            <h2> About the Game </h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</strong> is a 2022 action role-playing game developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo and The Pokémon Company for the Nintendo Switch. It is part of the eighth generation of the Pokémon video game series and serves as a prequel to <em> Pokémon Diamond and Pearl </em> (2006). The game was first announced as part of the Pokémon 25th Anniversary event in February 2021, and was released worldwide on 28 January 2022. The game follows the protagonist, sent back through time, as they travel through the Hisui region based on the island of Hokkaido during early Japanese colonization. Centered around exploration of the region's several open areas populated with Pokémon, the game's objective is to complete a roster of the region's Pokémon, known as the Pokédex. Pokémon Legends: Arceus received generally favorable reviews and was a commercial success, having sold over 12 million copies.

          <h2> Gameplay </h2>
          <p>
            Unlike in previous titles, the player character themselves can be attacked and harmed by wild Pokémon. If enough damage is taken, they will fall unconscious and reappear at the base camp.[9] Players can capture wild Pokémon in the overworld without engaging in battle, though some must still be battled before being caught. Battles can be initiated by releasing captured Pokémon near a wild Pokémon.[1][10] While the turn-based battle system of the prior titles is retained in the game, an additional feature is added which allows players to trade attack damage for more turns and vice versa. Outside standard battles, the game also introduces special boss battles where the player character has to dodge and attack powerful Pokémon, regular turn-based battles being included during the fights as opportunities to stun the bosses.[11]

          <h2> Story </h2>
          <p>
            The game begins with the player speaking with a disembodied voice, identified as Arceus, the creator deity of the Pokémon-Universe, which tasks the player with encountering all Pokémon in the Hisui region before transporting the player there through a rift in spacetime. The player is found by Pokémon researcher Professor Laventon, who brings the player to a local settlement named Jubilife Village. There, the player is recruited into the Survey Corps of the Galaxy Expedition Team, a group that has arrived in Hisui to chart and study the region. After receiving their starter Pokémon, the player proceeds to travel the Hisui region to complete the Pokédex. Throughout the player's journey, the spacetime rift they had been transported through results in several powerful "Noble Pokémon" venerated by the local Diamond and Pearl clans turning berserk through powerful lightning, forcing the player to engage them in battles using 'balms' to calm them down.

          <p>
            After the player defeats five noble Pokémon, the spacetime rift begins to worsen rather than calm down as per the Galaxy Team's expectations and the sky turns an ominous red color. Blamed for the instability, the player (who came through the same rift) is banished from Jubilife Village by Commander Kamado, leader of the Galaxy Team, and forced to travel the region again to address the cause of the rift. Working with either the Diamond or Pearl clans and under the care of a researcher of myths called Cogita, the player travels to the three major lakes of the region to encounter the legendary Pokémon Azelf, Mesprit and Uxie, the three beings that embody the mind. Once the player passes their trials, the three provide materials to craft the Red Chain needed to stop the rift. After defeating Commander Kamado at the summit, the player reaches the peak of Mount Coronet: The Temple of Sinnoh, at the center of the region. Depending on the clan the player worked with, either Dialga (Diamond Clan) or Palkia (Pearl Clan) appears first, breaks the Red Chain, and is caught by the player before their enraged counterpart emerges. Using the fragments of the Red Chain, a special Poké Ball capable of capturing the other legendary Pokémon is crafted. The player battles the legendary Pokémon in its Origin Forme and captures it, sealing the spacetime rift.

          <h2> <abbr title="Frequently Asked Questions"> FAQ </abbr> </h2>
          <details>
            <summary> What is Arceus? </summary>
            <p> Arceus is a pokemon that assumes the role of a god. It is known as the &quot;creator&quot; of the Hisui region.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary> Is Arceus a dragon type? </summary>
            <p> Arceus is not a dragon type. In fact, it is actually a normal type. This is a common misconception because Arceus looks similar to Dialga, Palkia, and Giratina, which are all dragon types.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary> Who do I play as? </summary>
            <p> Players can choose to be one of two characters. Akari is the female protagonist while Rei is the male protagonist. </p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary> Is Arceus overpowered? </summary>
            <p> In short, yes. Arceus has the highest stats compared to any other pokemon in the game. Additionally, Arceus has a move called &quot;judgement&quot; which gives it a type advantage over its opponent. </p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary> How do I get Arceus? </summary>
            <p> Players need to catch every pokemon in the game before they can battle Arceus. They can only aquire Arceus if they win the battle, which is the most difficult in the game. This is appropriate since catching Arceus marks the end of the story. </p>
